Now a day accidents are occurring frequently and it is very difficult to help them in critical conditions. We need an automatic system to monitor and inform whenever accidents occur while travelling. With the problem of global population aging increasing, lack of medical facility at the location of accident, inadequate accident sense system performance and other related issues have become increasingly prominent.
With the problem of global population aging increasing, lack of medical hardware at the near of accident place, inadequate accident sense system performance and other related issues have become increasingly prominent. This paper presents the design and implementation of scene of the accident alarm system based with wireless network communications based on ARM, GPS and GSM, Pre-set of treatment centre as the information processing terminal for the location display and warns the alarm for the treatment people near by the accident location.
This project consists of wireless communication for communication with the accident sense system and the Pre-set of treatment centre. The main part is the Pre-set of treatment unit, which acts as an Information processing unit. Individual vehicle is equipped with a system called as accident sense system, which consists of GSM and GPS. When the accident occurred, Vehicles state and locations will be transmitted to the Pre-set of treatment centre though wireless communication technologies of GSM through short message format.
